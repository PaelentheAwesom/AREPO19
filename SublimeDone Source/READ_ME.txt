Make sure you have copied SublimeJPC folder to your Desktop or Flashdrive.

The first steps are shared between all 3 languages:

1. Open the OPEN_THIS.exe in SublimeJPC
2. Drag "starter.java" from AREPO19 into the Sublime window
3. Click on "Tools" in the bar at the top of Sublime

Java: 
4. Hover over "Build Systems" until the dropdown appears, and select JavaExp
5. Once you are ready to compile, hit ctrl+shift+b together and click on "JavaExp" or hit enter. Alternatively, hit F7 to immediately build the class file.
6. To run your class file, hit ctrl+shift+b and select "Java Run".
To get rid of the little window that shows up, hit esc on the keyboard.

Python: (I'd recommend using the View>Layout tab to show 2 columns for Python)
4. Hover over "Build Systems" and select "PythonREPL"
5. In order to run your python file, hit F7
6. The Python shell will open in a new tab. You can use this as you would the 
normal shell. To close it, simply hit the x on the "*REPL* [python]" file.

C++:
4. Hover over "Build Systems" and select "MinGW-w64"
5. In order to compile your c++, hit F7
6. Run the .exe from your lab folder, or hit ctrl+shift+b and select "run".

Syntax: Sublime 3 highlights certain aspects of code according to the selected 
syntax. If opening a certain file doesn't automatically set the correct syntax, follow the following steps

1. Click on "View" in the top bar 
2. Hover over "Syntax"
3. Select the appropriate language
